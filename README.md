Tuzzy is a lightweight, cloud native developer portal being created that takes an opinionated approach to serving API documentation. 


### Building on what's good
Tuzzy uses the incredibly popular specification standard OpenAPI 3 as a bedrock for serving API documentation. This makes it trivial to plug it in and start serving your API documentation around your organisation and soon - the world!

You can inject an existing Swagger spec directly into Tuzzy, or let Tuzzy take care of it for you if your spec is available remotely. Tuzzy will make sure the specification is kept up to date, versioned, and available to all users.

Multiple specs can be linked, and APIs can be consolidated through a centralised, easy to use interface.
