## Tuzhub Component Library

`/lib` marks the directory containing all re-usable components.

The goal is to open source these styled components as an alternative component library for use in third party or future projects.

Tuzhub aspires to have a unique user experience, as such where possible all components should be developed using the `styled-components` library.
